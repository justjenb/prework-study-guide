# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide Webpage to help me understand the topics we will be covering in the Bootcamp. This gives me a foundation in HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript that I may not have already possesesed. Being exposed to a topic over and over again is the best way to learn.

I have some minor experience with all of the topics addressed in the study guide but there were and are still many things to learn, particularly in Git and JavaScript. I have experience with PowerShell and have used Git to sync my repositories to a work account but I was not very good at navigating through repos and keeping track of what was syncing where, and the items learned in the Prework have already helped me get a better grasp on how to accomplish this.
